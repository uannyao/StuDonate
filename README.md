# StuDonate - NWPlus Hack Camp Build Day
**StuDonate** is a software application that allows students to get items that they might need for free.

**Problem:**
The financial pressure on students has been growing, especially those from working-class backgrounds.

**Solution:**
A website where university students are able to donate items they don't need and want to give out to others. 

**How we built it:**
- HTML
- CSS
- JS

**Challenges we ran into:**
- There was a learning curve to using GitHub collaboratively for the first time
- Figuring out how to implement user interaction
- Formatting the explore page layout

**Future directions:**
- Implementing a map for users to explore nearby offers
- Chat feature for Giver and Recipient to communicate
- Adding short descriptions for each post on the explore page
